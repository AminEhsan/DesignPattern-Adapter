# Design Pattern Adapter
> Analysis and implementation of the Adapter Design Pattern

![Adapter](https://github.com/AminEhsan/DesignPattern-Adapter/blob/main/1.png) 

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## How to run Python
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Output :
> Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:
> Target: The default target's behavior.

> Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don't understand it:
> Adaptee: .eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS

> Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:
> Adapter: (TRANSLATED) Special behavior of the Adaptee.
